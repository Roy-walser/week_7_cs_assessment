The pattern i sa in the doublerAppend method was that it increases
based on how big the array is. The doublerInsert increased double 
almost triple way faster than the doublerAppend. The doublerInsert
started off more a little more consistent at first, if the array
is huge in size it's slower compared against the doublerAppend method.
